Well, if you want us to have an account for you, then apply for a job.
You can find the apply form here: 

#Roles Information (See apply form)
1. Community Manager
  He manages the forum and is the boss of the ticketter (See role 8).
2. Admin
  He is the most usefull person besides the owner. He can manage everything except adding accounts. But he can accept appliances.
3. Moderator
  He helps everyone with problems and manages mostly wagers and tournaments and the betting.
4. Tournament/Wager Operator
  He helps in the tournament so everything goes fine.
5. Streamer
  He streams all the matches so people who are betting can follow them every second!
6. Trader
  In the shop whe do not only have items like a monitor or something but also in-game items like a wheel for rocket league or something. But for some games whe cant use steam bots so we need traders who can get items from our storage and trade them to the gamers.
7. Web designer
  Of course we need updates to the site and thats why we need these. They make beautifull photos and need to have/learn the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript (JS). They have in our platform a tab where they can see the website live so they can see the changes while the site is offline for updating.
8. Ticketter
  People are probably going to have questions who need to be answered. That's why we need ticketter so they can answer them in speak or in chat live! A basic thing to have (for every role) is a headset.
  
#Meetings
Meetings are going to be announced in your platform mailbox in a mail around a week before. Answer them so we know if you can't come!!!
Most of the time we are going to speak but if someones headset is broken and warned us or we have exams we use the chatbox.
